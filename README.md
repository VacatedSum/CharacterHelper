# CharacterHelper
Very simple JavaFX application to assist with using Spanish characters.


Easy interface for Spanish characters. Simply click on the character, and it's copied to your clipboard. 

The window containing the characters has the 'Always on Top' property set, so it won't get hidden while shifting between a couple of documents.

Nothing fancy at all, but saved me from memorizing alt codes.
